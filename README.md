# Mini-Project: Naive Bayes


### Learning Objective :
- Learn the basic machine learning algorithms such as Supervised Learning Bayesian methods.
- Practice applying machine learning algorithms to real data. 

In the mini-project, basic text analysis was performed using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. I also used a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes.

### Data: 
          Rotten Tomatoes Dataset
